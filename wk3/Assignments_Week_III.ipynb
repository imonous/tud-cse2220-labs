    "**In this notebook you will be working on the mandatory assignments for week three of Signal Processing**. In order to complete the notebook you must complete all of the necessary code blocks (labelled with \"Write your code here\"), and fill in all answer blocks. Each section of the notebook will state the completion criteria, which summarize everything you need to do to complete that section. **If you are stuck on a section in this notebook, it may be beneficial to check the non-mandatory exercises for this week, since they may have content that can help you!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mandatory assignments are pass or fail. **If your notebook is incomplete - meaning you did not complete the task required or answer the necessary questions - then you will automatically fail.** So once you finish this notebook, please look through it to make sure you've answered everything!\n",
